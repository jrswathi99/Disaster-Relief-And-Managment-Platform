Project Proposal for Disaster Relief and Management Platform
Problem Statement
Natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes disrupt lives, causing severe damage
to infrastructure, resources, and human lives. A significant challenge in disaster relief efforts is
the lack of coordination among stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, logistics
companies, and volunteers. This lack of organization often results in delays, resource wastage,
and inefficient response times.
Additionally, critical activities such as resource allocation, transportation logistics, and volunteer
management are frequently disjointed, leading to unmet needs in high-priority areas. The
existing systems fail to provide a centralized platform for effective collaboration during disasters,
further complicating relief efforts.
Solution
The Disaster Relief and Management Platform is a centralized software system designed to
enhance disaster relief efforts through seamless coordination among stakeholders. The platform
enables disaster coordinators, zone managers, camp managers, and volunteers to collaborate
effectively, ensuring timely resource distribution, real-time incident reporting, and efficient task
management.
The solution provides:
● Multi-Tier Work Requests: Hierarchical requests for disaster relief tasks, including
high-level resource allocation and sub-requests for localized needs.
● Incident Reporting: Real-time submission of on-ground incidents by volunteers,
automatically triggering actionable work requests.
● Geo-Zonal Resource Allocation: Mocked geographical division of disaster zones to
prioritize resource delivery based on severity.
● Role-Based Management: Defined roles and access controls for disaster coordinators,
camp managers, medical officers, and other stakeholders.
● Budget Tracking: Monitoring of disaster relief budgets, expenditures, and financial
allocation.
● Transport and Logistics Coordination: Management of vehicles and supply chains to
ensure timely delivery of resources.
This platform fosters collaboration across various entities while addressing gaps in
communication, resource allocation, and task execution.
