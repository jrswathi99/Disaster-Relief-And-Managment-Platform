# 🌍 Disaster Relief and Management Platform

## 📌 Problem Statement
Natural disasters such as **floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes** cause massive damage to **infrastructure, resources, and human lives**. One of the biggest challenges in disaster relief efforts is the **lack of coordination** among key stakeholders, including **government agencies, NGOs, logistics companies, and volunteers**. 

Without a centralized system, disaster response suffers from:
- **Delays in resource allocation**
- **Inefficient transportation logistics**
- **Uncoordinated volunteer efforts**
- **Unmet needs in high-priority areas**

Existing systems fail to provide an **integrated platform for collaboration**, making disaster relief efforts less effective.
